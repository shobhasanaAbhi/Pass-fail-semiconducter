# 🧪 Semiconductor Wafer Pass/Fail Prediction

### 📘 **Project Overview**
In modern semiconductor fabrication, wafers undergo multiple expensive tests. Our deep learning-based system helps identify defective wafers early using image classification. 
This improves throughput, reduces retesting, and cuts production costs.
A simple yet effective web application using **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow** to classify wafer images as either **Pass ✅** or **Fail ❌** based on image analysis. 
This tool helps in identifying defective semiconductor wafers via a visual interface powered by a deep learning model.
